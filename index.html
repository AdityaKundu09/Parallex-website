        <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time !</h2>
        <p class="text">
          In the realm of Ooo, where magic blooms, Finn and Jake, amidst
          whimsical fumes. Princesses fair and monsters bizarre, Adventure
          beckons from near and far
          <br /><br />
          With laughter and courage, they journey on, In a land where the
          unusual spawns. Infinite tales in this whimsical clime, Adventure
          Time, a timeless rhyme.

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Pedaling through winding roads, breeze kissing my face, freedom
          unfurls. Each turn, a new adventure; hills conquer doubt, downhill
          thrills my soul.
          <br /><br />
          The rhythm of the wheels, a symphony of motion. Biking: a journey of
          self, a dance with nature's grace, a path to liberation.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Gliding high, on wings of air, Para-gliders soar without a care. Wind
          whispers secrets, sky's embrace, In this serene and weightless space.
          <br /><br />
          Above the world, they dance and play, In sunlit realms, they find
          their way. Adventurers bold, with hearts alight, Para-gliding dreams
          take flight
        </p>

        <div class="bg bg3">
          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          On waves of azure, beneath the sun's glow, Surfers ride, where the
          ocean's rhythms flow. Balance and grace, atop the crest they glide, In
          harmony with the tide's gentle stride.
          <br /><br />
          Salt in the air, a thrill in their veins, Surfing's allure, eternal
          remains
